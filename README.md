##  Welcome to Bamazon!

I would like to introduce you to the Bamazon app. I have created a Command Line userinterface for customer as well as for a manager accessing the Bamazon database.

For the customer app, the customer will be shown a selection of products they can purchase. After which, they can insert the item's ID number and the number of items they would like to purchase.

For the manager app, the manager can view the full list of products for sale, view a list of products with low inventory, add inventory to current items, or add new products for sale.
